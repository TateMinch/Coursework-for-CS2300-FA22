PART 1:
Kind of totally lost here - 
How do I tell if it is a parallel projection?
If it is not a parallel projection, does that mean num 7, 8, and 9 are just random numbers or is there nothing there?
Defines the normal to the plane before normalization? What does that mean? I don't understand what these pieces are supposed to represent
What should the output files look like?

A -
For each point (three per line after first line, correct?) How to project? I don't see this algorithm anywhere

B -
Perspective Projection? I'm assuming it will be the same algorithm as above, but the direction will just be -x instead of the one given in first line,
correct?

PART 2:
A - 
Please help me understand the format for the lines and what they represent?
First 6 points are plane? What does that look like? Once I've got that down, what does the process for finding distance look like? Is it like this?

B - 
First 3 of first line are one point, second 3 are another, do the last three mean anything? Direction?
Once I understand what the points in the line represent, can you help me understand the algorithm to implement? I don't see in the notes where we did this with this format?


PART 3:
Can I use a package for matrix multiplication and stuff since I've implemented it by hand already, but this is much cleaner?
What is input file going to look like floating point value wise? Do you have any idea why this isn't working?
What allowance should I use?
(outside of that issue)
Have I done this correctly?
Does the output matter or does what I have now work?
